# ABOUT THIS PROJECT
This is a real-time Challenge dataset by Onyx DataDNA that I tackled to derive meaningful insights from and to help the managers and leadership of a mobile Phone Retail Company where I sat in the seat as a data analyst for this major mobile phone retailer operating across multiple countries.

## THERE ARE 6 MAIN STEPS I FOLLOWED IN TACKLING THIS PROJECT. WHICH ARE:
1. IDENTIFYING THE BUSINESS' PROBLEMS
2. DEFINING OUR GOAL FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT
3. WALKING THROUGH KEY VISUALS AND STRATEGIES
4. HIGHLIGHTING INSIGHTS
5. RECOMMENDATIONS
6. CONCLUSION

# THE BUSINESS PROBLEM
We’ve been given a 2024 sales dataset, containing detailed records of mobile phone transactions, customer demographics, product specifications, and geographic locations. The dataset combines information about the models sold, their prices, storage sizes, colors, operating systems, and customer demographics like age group and gender. It also captures where and how the sales were made – online, through partners, or in-store, and the type of payment used.
We are to build a report that tells the story of mobile sales across different regions, highlights best-selling products and trends, and helps the business understand customer behavior better.

# THE GOAL FOR THIS PROJECT
My goal drafting this project is to highlight Total Revenue, month-over-month revenue, Best-selling products(Android and IOS) Separately, Sales Trends and to provide in-depth insights so management can rely on in making concrete decisions going forward.

# EXPLAINING KEY VISUALS AND MY STRATEGIES
I broke this analysis down into 3 different pages.
### 1. Overview or A summary Page
### 2. An Android Only Analysis Page
### 3. An IOS / Iphone Only Analysis Page

## STRATEGY GOING INTO THIS PRODUCT
So going into the project, my strategy was simple. Use the Drill Through and Tooltip functions in Power BI. Why drill through and ToolTips?

### Drill Through:
Drill through because, I anticipated that managers would most likely wanna know in-depth analysis for their products.
Examples:
What are the top 10 best selling products? Can we know which cities we made the  the most revenues from these top products?, Which colours did they prefer the most for the top selling products? What month did they really contribute the most revenue for these products etc.
And so I believed that the drill through would be an awesome addition to give them quick replies but relevant answers to their most pressing questions.

### Tooltips
Because similar to the drill through function, the tooltip also helps in lightning and clarifying my report without taking more additionally unnecesary spaces which deviates from the main purpose of this assignment. An example of what I did with tooltip is when I used it to give more details about Total revenues by cities by simply hovering over on a selected city on the (Map Chart).

## OVERVIEW OR SUMMARY PAGE
This dashboard page provides a comprehensive overview of the company's overall performance. It answers questions such as:
The overall quantity of mobile phones ordered, what is out total revenue after sales?, How much revenue did we get from sales of IOS Phones only and How much we got from the sales of Android phones only as this helps the company to know which phones they should focus on the most, I also looked at the overall revenue by phone model to see which ones are outperforming the rest, Details of age group behavior, which group prefers IOS the most and vice versa as well as which group prefer Android and vice versa,
I also analysed the month-To-Day Sales and Month-Over-Month Revenue Percentage. Lastly but surely not the least, I looked at the top 10 cities contributing the most sales.
Overhead are slicers to help managers easily slice and dice without any stress whatsoever.
