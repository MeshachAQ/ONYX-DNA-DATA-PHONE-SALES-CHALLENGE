# ABOUT THIS PROJECT
This is a real-time Challenge dataset by Onyx DataDNA that I tackled to derive meaningful insights from and to help the managers and leadership of a mobile Phone Retail Company where I sat in the seat as a data analyst for this major mobile phone retailer operating across multiple countries.

## THERE ARE 6 MAIN STEPS I FOLLOWED IN TACKLING THIS PROJECT. WHICH ARE:
1. IDENTIFYING THE BUSINESS' PROBLEMS
2. DEFINING OUR GOAL FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT
3. WALKING THROUGH KEY VISUALS AND STRATEGIES
4. HIGHLIGHTING INSIGHTS
5. RECOMMENDATIONS
6. CONCLUSION

# THE BUSINESS PROBLEM
We’ve been given a 2024 sales dataset, containing detailed records of mobile phone transactions, customer demographics, product specifications, and geographic locations. The dataset combines information about the models sold, their prices, storage sizes, colors, operating systems, and customer demographics like age group and gender. It also captures where and how the sales were made – online, through partners, or in-store, and the type of payment used.
We are to build a report that tells the story of mobile sales across different regions, highlights best-selling products and trends, and helps the business understand customer behavior better.

# THE GOAL FOR THIS PROJECT
My goal drafting this project is to highlight Total Revenue, month-over-month revenue, Best-selling products(Android and IOS) Separately, Sales Trends and to provide in-depth insights so management can rely on in making concrete decisions going forward.

# EXPLAINING KEY VISUALS AND MY STRATEGIES
I broke this analysis down into 3 different pages.
### 1. Overview or A summary Page
### 2. An Android Only Analysis Page
### 3. An IOS / Iphone Only Analysis Page

## STRATEGY GOING INTO THIS PRODUCT
So going into the project, my strategy was simple. Use the Drill Through and Tooltip functions in Power BI. Why drill through and ToolTips?

### Drill Through:
Drill through because, I anticipated that managers would most likely wanna know in-depth analysis for their products.
Examples:
What are the top 10 best selling products? Can we know which cities we made the  the most revenues from these top products?, Which colours did they prefer the most for the top selling products? What month did they really contribute the most revenue for these products etc.
And so I believed that the drill through would be an awesome addition to give them quick replies but relevant answers to their most pressing questions.

### Tooltips
Because similar to the drill through function, the tooltip also helps in lightning and clarifying my report without taking more additionally unnecesary spaces which deviates from the main purpose of this assignment. An example of what I did with tooltip is when I used it to give more details about Total revenues by cities by simply hovering over on a selected city on the (Map Chart).

## OVERVIEW OR SUMMARY PAGE
This dashboard page provides a comprehensive overview of the company's overall performance. It answers questions such as:
The overall quantity of mobile phones ordered, what is out total revenue after sales?, How much revenue did we get from sales of IOS Phones only and How much we got from the sales of Android phones only as this helps the company to know which phones they should focus on the most, I also looked at the overall revenue by phone model to see which ones are outperforming the rest, Details of age group behavior, which group prefers IOS the most and vice versa as well as which group prefer Android and vice versa,
I also analysed the month-To-Day Sales and Month-Over-Month Revenue Percentage. Lastly but surely not the least, I looked at the top 10 cities contributing the most sales.
Overhead are slicers to help managers easily slice and dice without any stress whatsoever.


## OVERVIEW OF ANDROID PAGE ANALYSIS

This dashboard specifically, provides a comprehensive analysis of IOS/Iphone Sales. it's essential as it is helps this Company identify Top Selling IOS/IPhones only and respective properties, track revenue, Customer Age group behavior, and compare revenue by Monthly and Weekly trends. The company surely can rely on this dashboard to monitor it's revenues by IOS/IPhones Only. Even better, is combining the drill through function to digest even further.

# HIGHLIGHTING INSIGHTS
1. The analysis shows that the number of orders for Android is far exceeds that of android. The analysis shows that the sales of android is almost 4 times that of IOS putting Android in a more favorable spot against IOS.
2. I also Identify that people in the customer age bracket of 42-49 happen to lean more towards the use of android phones than IOS. As the data shows a staggering 2863 people placed others for android with people in the age bracket of 26-33 coming close second at 2861 orders for android. Out of this, The number of females ordering these android phones far exceeded the number of male and other bracket. For instance in the age bracket of 42-49 that top the chart, we see that 1740 of these orders were made by females. Likewise, in the age bracket of 26-33, we deduce that, 1607 of these android orders placed where made by females.
3. The data shows that even though Android Phone Z fold 6 made the most revenue, it also tells that it is the android OnePlus Nord 4 that received the most quantity ordered.
4. We also see that revenue for Android phones during January, February and August. These three months saw significant sales compared to months like May, September, November and April even though the fall of revenue isn't exponentially significant, it still affects the revenue negatively.
5. For IOS/Iphones, we again see January and February leading in revenues with months like September and April still trying to keep us. This tells us that overall, majority of revenue typically came from January and February whereas September and April saw a relatively low sales in these months
6. Again when it comes to IOS/Iphones, even though we analyze that iphone 15 pro contributed the most revenue, it wasn't the most sort after IOS Device. Infact the most sort after device was the iphone 14. with total orders for iphone 14 being 989 and iphone 15 being 793, I believe its safe to say people who go in for IOS devices prefer the iphone 14 compared to the iphone 15 pro maybe due to how the iphone 15 pro is more expenseive.
7. Also, the overall IOS/Iphone qantity ordered stands at only about 4200 whereas android stands at 14300, indicating the demad for Android phones against IOS Phones.
8. When we look at the customer age group behavior for which group preferred IOS more, we realise something. We realise that, 26-33 hold the most number of people who ordered the most IOS Devices and who contributed the most revenue for IOS Devices.Of these, we further deduce that the male gender placed more orders compared to the other genders.

# RECOMMENDATIONS
### Product & Inventory Recommendations
1 Stock More Android Devices, Especially Mid-Range Models
Since Android sales and quantity far exceed iOS (14,300 vs. 4,200), and mid-range phones like the OnePlus Nord 4 are top in demand, increase inventory for such models.

A. Prioritize quantity over premium models.

B. Bundle offers on popular Android models during peak months.

2. Continue Offering Premium Android Options
Despite not being the most ordered, Z Fold 6 generates the most revenue—indicating demand for high-end Androids. Keep a small but visible stock of flagship models for
revenue maximization.

3. For iPhones, Prioritize iPhone 14 over 15 Pro
The iPhone 14 is more sought after than the 15 Pro despite the latter generating more revenue. Maintain sufficient iPhone 14 stock, and offer financing or discounts to improve 15 Pro demand.

### Customer Segmentation & Marketing Recommendations
4. Target Female Android Users Aged 42–49 and 26–33
With 1740 and 1607 orders respectively, female users dominate Android purchases in these age brackets.

A. Use tailored digital ads, influencers, and language appealing to mid-age women.

B. Consider bundle packages (e.g., phone + accessories) for this demographic.

5. Target Male iOS Users Aged 26–33
This group leads in both orders and revenue for iPhones.

A. Promote features like performance, status, and productivity.

B. Highlight brand prestige and value-for-money messaging.

### Sales Timing & Campaign Planning
6. Capitalize on January & February (High Sales Months)
Both Android and iOS see peak revenue in these months.

A. Launch new models, promotions, or “Back to Work/School” campaigns.

B. Offer trade-in programs or early bird deals.

7. Boost Marketing in May, April, September, and November
These months see relatively lower sales.

A. Run clearance sales or limited-time offers.

B. Use targeted retargeting ads to re-engage past customers.

### Strategic Recommendations
8. Explore Why Android Dominates
Consider surveying customers to understand price sensitivity, feature preferences, or brand loyalty—especially among Android users. This can help refine future product offerings.

Differentiate Marketing Messages by OS

A. Android: Focus on affordability, flexibility, and variety.

B. iOS: Focus on status, security, and ecosystem integration.

# CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the analysis clearly highlights a strong customer preference for Android devices, particularly among female users aged 42–49 and 26–33, with significant demand for mid-range models like the OnePlus Nord 4. While iPhones, especially the iPhone 14, remain popular among younger male users, overall iOS sales lag behind Android. Seasonal trends also show that January and February are key revenue months, underscoring the need for strategic marketing and inventory planning around these periods. These insights provide a valuable foundation for targeted marketing, optimized stock management, and tailored customer engagement to drive future sales growth.
